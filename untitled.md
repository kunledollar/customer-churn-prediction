# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn (customer attrition) using supervised machine learning techniques.
It demonstrates an end-to-end applied machine learning workflow suitable for real-world business problems.

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn dataset (public dataset).

## Problem Statement
Customer churn directly impacts revenue. The goal of this project is to identify customers who are likely to churn so that retention strategies can be applied proactively.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding
- Model training and evaluation
- Model comparison

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Evaluation Metric
- ROC-AUC

## Key Findings
- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.
- Tree-based models captured non-linear patterns better than linear models.

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
This project was completed as an academic and hands-on machine learning project.
